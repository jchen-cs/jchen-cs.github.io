One thing I didn't mention in my original post was that I scored this awesome MATLAB hat at the exhibition hall. I enjoyed chatting with the Mathworks folks about the experiments I was doing with STL verification using MATLAB/Simulink. I've been looking for a MATLAB hat for a while now, so I hope they know how happy I am to finally have one!
